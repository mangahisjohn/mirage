                <h1>Augmented reality has a problem</h1>
                <p>The full potential of augmented reality is restricted by a lack of accessibility. AR is currently only offered as a feature on certain websites or on company-specific apps. In order to offer both businesses and consumers the full use and entertainment potential of AR, these features need to be united into a single platform.</p>

                <h1>A single platform solution</h1>
                <p>Mirage's platform creates a space for users to interact with augmented reality in a convenient and accessible way. The platform draws together existing AR features onto a single platform and implements local data transfer techniques to create interactive multi-user experiences that enhance daily life. The platform is a new medium for socialising and creates opportunities for companies and consumers alike.
