                <h1>The vision</h1>
                <p>Mirage's platform creates a space for users to interact with augmented reality in a convenient and accessible way. The platform draws together existing AR features on one platform and implements local data transfer techniques to create interactive multi-user experiences that enhance daily life. The platform will be a new medium for socialising and brings with it opportunities for companies and consumers alike. Businesses can create unique AR products and services, dynamic and insightful advertisements and interesting and engaging events whilst consumers can discover a space for creativity and entertainment.</p>

                <h1>The problem</h1>
                <p>The full potential of augmented reality is currently restricted by a lack of accessibility.  AR is currently only offered as a feature on certain websites or on company-specific apps. In order to offer both businesses and consumers the full use and entertainment potential of AR, these features need to be united into a single platform.</p>
