                <h1>The problem</h1>
                <p>Mirage's platform creates a space for users to interact with augmented reality in a convenient and accessible way. The platform draws together existing AR features and introduces multi-user functionality to facilitate localised interactive experiences that enhance daily life. The platform will be a new medium for interaction and brings with it opportunities for businesses and consumers. Businesses can create unique AR products and services, dynamic and insightful advertisements and interesting and engaging events whilst consumers can discover a space for creativity and enjoyment.</p>

                <h1>The vision</h1>
                <p>The full potential of augmented reality is currently restricted by a lack of accessibility.  AR is largely offered as a feature on certain websites or at most as a single-use app, specific to individual companies. In order to offer both businesses and consumers the full use and entertainment potential of AR, these features need to be united into a single platform.</p>

                            <p>The platform's marketplace is the primary way in which users can acquire AR items. Mirage encourages a creator economy and a new way for businesses and individuals to earn through AR digital assets. This helps to provide a diverse offering of products available on the marketplace feature.</p>
